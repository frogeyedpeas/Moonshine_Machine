So the current plan:


1. Build a stable downloader for OEIS (this can be upgraded later to ArXiV)
2. We then define a parser that can store the sequences in some type of database
3. We then create a coincidence-type-library, and have a script that uses it to explore for a set of coincidences 
4. This get stored in a DB by coincidence type 
5. Now we host a website that allows you to see for each type, a list of all the coincidences, and people can go ahead and upvote and downvote coincidences
